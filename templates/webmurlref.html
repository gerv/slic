Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise

implementation of VP8 or any code incorporated within this implementation of

patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
for this implementation of VP8 shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.
