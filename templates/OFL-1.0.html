SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------
<br><br>
PREAMBLE<br>
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
others.
<br><br>
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font
names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license.
<br><br>

	- source code<br>
	- build scripts<br>

<br><br>
"Reserved Font Name" refers to the Font Software name as seen by
users and any other names as specified after the copyright statement.
<br><br>
"Standard Version" refers to the collection of Font Software
components as distributed by the Copyright Holder.
